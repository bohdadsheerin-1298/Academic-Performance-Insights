📊 Academic-Performance-Insights

This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance across 5 major subjects using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to derive insights such as:

-> Subject-wise performance

-> Top and low-performing students

-> Pass/Fail analysis

-> Class-level comparison

-> Personalized dashboard insights

This project showcases a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow.

🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)

Performed in analysis.ipynb:

-> Removed missing and invalid values

-> Added Percentage column

-> Added Result (Pass/Fail) column

-> Fixed data types

-> Exported clean dataset

🗃 SQL Tasks

Stored in create_table.sql & analysis_queries.sql:

* Creating student table

* Loading CSV into MySQL

* Subject-wise average
